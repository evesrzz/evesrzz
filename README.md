<h3 align="center"> Geographic Information System | Pyhton </h3>

I'm currently a student in the Geographic Information Systems degree program at UNTREF and in the Data Analyst Certification program at Digital House, with a focus on Python.

I am 24 years old and 
I've been working in areas as Customer Service and Collections for almost 3 years. This experiences allowed to develop strong soft skills in communication, typing and problem-solving. 
Now, I keen on being part of a company where I can challenge myself and further develop my skills.


My hard skills include Excel, QGIS and Python.
